Client Service is in charge of the following:
    - Adding new clients to the system
    - Receiving general queries messages from the clients
    - Updating clients. This could be for the following reasons:
        * When they have been added to a new policy. (add bind to queue)
        * When they have been removed from a policy. (remove bind from queue)
        * When the user changes what needs to be backed up
